`pedalboard` is a Python library for adding effects to audio. It supports a number of common audio effects out of the box, and also allows the use of [VST3®](https://www.steinberg.net/en/company/technologies/vst3.html) and [Audio Unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_Units) plugin formats for third-party effects. It was built by [Spotify's Audio Intelligence Lab](https://research.atspotify.com/audio-intelligence/) to enable using studio-quality audio effects from within Python and TensorFlow.

Internally at Spotify, `pedalboard` is used for [data augmentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_augmentation) to improve machine learning models. `pedalboard` also helps in the process of content creation, making it possible to add effects to audio without using a Digital Audio Workstation.

## Usage 

 - Built-in support for a number of basic audio transformations: 
   - `Convolution`
   - `Compressor`
   - `Chorus`
   - `Distortion`
   - `Gain`
   - `HighpassFilter`
   - `LadderFilter`
   - `Limiter`
   - `LowpassFilter`
   - `Phaser`
   - `Reverb`
 - Supports VST3® plugins on macOS, Windows, and Linux
 - Supports Audio Units on macOS
 - Strong thread-safety, memory usage, and speed guarantees
   - Releases Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) to allow use of multiple CPU cores
     - No need to use `multiprocessing`!
   - Even when only using one thread:
     - Processes audio up to **300x** faster than [pySoX](https://github.com/rabitt/pysox)
 - Tested compatibility with TensorFlow - can be used in `tf.data` pipelines!

## Installation

`pedalboard` is available via PyPI (via [Platform Wheels](https://packaging.python.org/guides/distributing-packages-using-setuptools/#platform-wheels)):
```
pip install pedalboard
```

If you are new to Python, follow [INSTALLATION.md](https://github.com/spotify/pedalboard/blob/master/INSTALLATION.md) for a robust guide.

### Compatibility

`pedalboard` is thoroughly tested with Python 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, and 3.9, as well as experimental support for PyPy 7.3.

- Linux
  - Tested heavily in production use cases at Spotify
  - Tested automatically on GitHub with VSTs
  - Platform `manylinux` wheels built for `x86_64`
  - Most Linux VSTs require a relatively modern Linux installation (with glibc > 2.27)
- macOS
  - Tested manually with VSTs and Audio Units
  - Tested automatically on GitHub with VSTs
  - Platform wheels available for both Intel and Apple Silicon
  - Compatible with a wide range of VSTs and Audio Units
- Windows
  - Tested automatically on GitHub with VSTs
  - Platform wheels available for `amd64` (Intel/AMD)

#### Plugin Compatibility

`pedalboard` allows loading VST3® and Audio Unit plugins, which could contain _any_ code.
Most plugins that have been tested work just fine with `pedalboard`, but some plugins may
not work with `pedalboard`; at worst, some may even crash the Python interpreter without
warning and with no ability to catch the error. For an ever-growing compatibility list,
see [COMPATIBILITY.md](COMPATIBILITY.md).

Most audio plugins are "well-behaved" and conform to a set of conventions for how audio
plugins are supposed to work, but many do not conform to the VST3® or Audio Unit
specifications. `pedalboard` attempts to detect some common programming errors in plugins
and can work around many issues, including automatically detecting plugins that don't
clear their internal state when asked. Even so, plugins can misbehave without `pedalboard`
noticing.

If audio is being rendered incorrectly or if audio is "leaking" from one `process()` call
to the next in an undesired fashion, try:

1. Passing silence to the plugin in between calls to `process()`, to ensure that any
   reverb tails or other internal state has time to fade to silence
1. Reloading the plugin every time audio is processed (with `pedalboard.load_plugin`)

## Examples

A very basic example of how to use `pedalboard`'s built-in plugins:

```python
import soundfile as sf
from pedalboard import (
    Pedalboard,
    Convolution,
    Compressor,
    Chorus,
    Gain,
    Reverb,
    Limiter,
    LadderFilter,
    Phaser,
)

audio, sample_rate = sf.read('some-file.wav')

# Make a Pedalboard object, containing multiple plugins:
board = Pedalboard([
    Compressor(threshold_db=-50, ratio=25),
    Gain(gain_db=30),
    Chorus(),
    LadderFilter(mode=LadderFilter.Mode.HPF12, cutoff_hz=900),
    Phaser(),
    Convolution("./guitar_amp.wav", 1.0),
    Reverb(room_size=0.25),
], sample_rate=sample_rate)

# Pedalboard objects behave like lists, so you can add plugins:
board.append(Compressor(threshold_db=-25, ratio=10))
board.append(Gain(gain_db=10))
board.append(Limiter())

# Run the audio through this pedalboard!
effected = board(audio)

# Write the audio back as a wav file:
with sf.SoundFile('./processed-output-stereo.wav', 'w', samplerate=sample_rate, channels=len(effected.shape)) as f:
    f.write(effected)

```

### Loading a VST3® plugin and manipulating its parameters

```python
import soundfile as sf
from pedalboard import Pedalboard, Reverb, load_plugin

# Load a VST3 package from a known path on disk:
vst = load_plugin("./VSTs/RoughRider3.vst3")

print(vst.parameters.keys())
# dict_keys([
#   'sc_hpf_hz',
#   'input_lvl_db',
#   'sensitivity_db',
#   'ratio',
#   'attack_ms',
#   'release_ms',
#   'makeup_db',
#   'mix',
#   'output_lvl_db',
#   'sc_active',
#   'full_bandwidth',
#   'bypass',
#   'program',
# ])

# Set the "ratio" parameter to 15
vst.ratio = 15

# Use this VST to process some audio:
audio, sample_rate = sf.read('some-file.wav')
effected = vst(audio, sample_rate=sample_rate)

# ...or put this VST into a chain with other plugins:
board = Pedalboard([vst, Reverb()], sample_rate=sample_rate)
# ...and run that pedalboard with the same VST instance!
effected = board(audio)
```

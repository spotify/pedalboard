    Time-stretch (and optionally pitch-shift) a buffer of audio, changing its length.

    Using a higher ``stretch_factor`` will shorten the audio - i.e., a ``stretch_factor``
    of ``2.0`` will double the *speed* of the audio and halve the *length* of the audio,
    without changing the pitch of the audio.

    This function allows for changing the pitch of the audio during the time stretching
    operation. The ``stretch_factor`` and ``pitch_shift_in_semitones`` arguments are
    independent and do not affect each other (i.e.: you can change one, the other, or both
    without worrying about how they interact).

    The additional arguments provided to this function allow for more fine-grained control
    over the behavior of the time stretcher:

      - ``high_quality`` (the default) enables a higher quality time stretching mode.
        Set this option to ``False`` to use less CPU power.

      - ``transient_mode`` controls the behavior of the stretcher around transients
        (percussive parts of the audio). Valid options are ``"crisp"`` (the default),
        ``"mixed"``, or ``"smooth"``.

      - ``transient_detector`` controls which method is used to detect transients in the
        audio signal. Valid options are ``"compound"`` (the default), ``"percussive"``,
        or ``"soft"``.

      - ``retain_phase_continuity`` ensures that the phases of adjacent frequency bins in
        the audio stream are kept as similar as possible. Set this to ``False`` for a
        softer, phasier sound.

      - ``use_long_fft_window`` controls the size of the fast-Fourier transform window
        used during stretching. The default (``None``) will result in a window size that
        varies based on other parameters and should produce better results in most
        situations. Set this option to ``True`` to result in a smoother sound (at the
        expense of clarity and timing), or ``False`` to result in a crisper sound.

      - ``use_time_domain_smoothing`` can be enabled to produce a softer sound with
        audible artifacts around sharp transients. This option mixes well with
        ``use_long_fft_window=False``.

      - ``preserve_formants`` allows shifting the pitch of notes without substantially
        affecting the pitch profile (formants) of a voice or instrument.

    .. warning::
        This is a function, not a :py:class:`Plugin` instance, and cannot be
        used in :py:class:`Pedalboard` objects, as it changes the duration of
        the audio stream.

      R"(A base class for readable and writeable audio files.

:class:`AudioFile` may be used just like a regular Python ``open``
function call, to open an audio file for reading (with the default ``"r"`` mode)
or for writing (with the ``"w"`` mode).

Unlike a typical ``open`` call:
 - :class:`AudioFile` objects can only be created in read (``"r"``) or write (``"w"``) mode.
   All audio files are binary (so a trailing ``b`` would be redundant) and appending to an
   existing audio file is not possible.
 - If opening an audio file in write mode (``"w"``), one additional argument is required:
   the sample rate of the file.
 - A file-like object can be provided to :class:`AudioFile`, allowing for reading and
   writing to in-memory streams or buffers. The provided file-like object must be seekable
   and must be opened in binary mode (i.e.: ``io.BinaryIO`` instead of ``io.StringIO``, 
   if using the `io` package).


Examples
--------

Opening an audio file on disk::

   with AudioFile("my_file.mp3") as f:
       first_ten_seconds = f.read(int(f.samplerate * 10))


Opening a file-like object::

   ogg_buffer: io.BytesIO = get_audio_buffer(...)
   with AudioFile(ogg_buffer) as f:
       first_ten_seconds = f.read(int(f.samplerate * 10))


Opening an audio file on disk, while resampling on-the-fly::

    with AudioFile("my_file.mp3").resampled_to(22_050) as f:
       first_ten_seconds = f.read(int(f.samplerate * 10))


Writing an audio file on disk::

   with AudioFile("white_noise.wav", "w", samplerate=44100, num_channels=2) as f:
       f.write(np.random.rand(2, 44100))


Writing encoded audio to a file-like object::

   wav_buffer = io.BytesIO()
   with AudioFile(wav_buffer, "w", samplerate=44100, num_channels=2, format="wav") as f:
       f.write(np.random.rand(2, 44100))
   wav_buffer.getvalue()  # do something with the file-like object


Writing to an audio file while also specifying quality options for the codec::

   with AudioFile(
       "white_noise.mp3",
       "w",
       samplerate=44100,
       num_channels=2,
       quality=160,  # kilobits per second
   ) as f:
       f.write(np.random.rand(2, 44100))


Re-encoding a WAV file as an MP3 in four lines of Python::

   with AudioFile("input.wav") as i:
       with AudioFile("output.mp3", "w", i.samplerate, i.num_channels) as o:
           while i.tell() < i.frames:
               o.write(i.read(1024))


.. note::
    Calling the :class:`AudioFile` constructor does not actually return an
    :class:`AudioFile`. If opening an audio file in read ("r") mode, a
    :class:`ReadableAudioFile` will be returned. If opening an audio file
    in write ("w") mode, a :class:`WriteableAudioFile` will be returned. See
    those classes below for documentation.
